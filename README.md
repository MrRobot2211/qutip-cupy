Installation
------------

`qutip-cupy` is not yet officially released.

If you want to try out the package you will need to have a CUDA enabled GPU, `QuTiP >5.0.0` and `CuPy`.
We recommend using a conda environment `Python >= 3.7`.
To install `CuPy` we recommend the following steps:

- conda install -c conda-forge cupy

To install `QuTiP >5.0.0` while it is not yet released we recommend:

- python -mpip install git+https://github.com/qutip/qutip.git@dev.major

Now you can safely install `qutip_cupy`

- python -mpip install git+https://github.com/qutip/qutip-cupy.git
